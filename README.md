# Secure Derived Credential Demo -- Android

### About ###
This demonstration is a modified version of the [PIV Opacity Derived Credential Demonstration](https://github.com/PIVopacity/PIVOpacityDerivedCred-android).  In this demo, a self-signed credential is generated in the mobile device directly--as opposed to the alternate demonstration of deriving a credential from an OPACITY enabled PIV/CAC card.  Other elements were also changed such as service names and AIDs to allow the two demonstrations to function simultaneously on a single mobile device.  It is recommended that the original [demonstration] (https://github.com/PIVopacity/PIVOpacityDerivedCred-android) continue to be used as a reference for derived credentials from cards, as it aligns closely with NIST SP 800-73-4.  However, this modified demonstration illustrates the benefits and transaction flow that can nevertheless still be achieved on mobile devices, even in the absence of readily available OPACITY enabled cards.
